/**
 * Watches a single JSONL file and emits parsed objects line-by-line as the
 * file grows. Append-only: it remembers a byte offset and reads everything
 * past it on the tick of a polling-based stat watcher.
 *
 * Partial trailing lines are buffered until the next read brings the
 * terminating newline.
 *
 * Why fs.watchFile (poll) instead of chokidar's fs.watch path:
 *   chokidar on macOS defaults to fs.watch-based change detection for
 *   single files, which is known to silently miss rapid appends from
 *   non-editor writers (append-only files that don't atomic-rename).
 *   Users saw it concretely: submit a prompt, CC writes
 *   the user entry + a bunch of attachments to the JSONL, and the
 *   feed wouldn't update until some unrelated later write nudged
 *   chokidar into re-reading. "The prompt didn't appear."
 *
 *   fs.watchFile polls stat() on an interval and fires whenever
 *   size/mtime changes. At 100ms interval the latency is imperceptible
 *   (~half a human reaction time), the CPU cost is trivial (one stat
 *   call every 100ms per tailer), and it's reliable on every fs/OS
 *   combination because it doesn't rely on kernel event delivery.
 *
 * Concurrency: `readNew()` can be triggered while a previous read is
 * still in flight — the fs.read stream is async, so its `end` handler
 * (where `offset` is advanced) runs on a future tick. Without
 * serialization a second trigger could read from a stale offset,
 * producing duplicate emits AND stomping `offset` backwards in the
 * first call's `end` handler. The `reading` / `pendingRead` flags
 * below form a simple "queue at most one re-entry" pattern: while a
 * read is in flight, subsequent triggers just set `pendingRead`; when
 * the in-flight read completes we immediately re-run if anything was
 * queued. This guarantees strict serialization with zero unbounded
 * queuing and zero concurrency.
